edna is a work in progress text editor inspired by the UNIX standard, ed.

(note: this document is correct as of commit 40a1333 ("forgot to commit all the new files") if
 this is not the lastest commit, edna may have diverged from what is described
 here)

at the moment edna is quite barebones -- the supported commands are:
	- 'a' to append a single line, advancing the cursor one line
	- 'd' to unlink and free and single line
	- 'h' to explain the last error
	- 'p' to print the current line
	- 'q' to free the buffer and exit successfully
	- '-' to go back one line in the buffer
	- '+' to go forward one line in the buffer

hacking guide:
	- the text document is represented as a doubly linked list, with functions
	  acting as manipulations on this object
	- system calls (malloc, memcpy, printf, etc.) are invoked as macros with check
	  their return value and print errno if something happens. please follow this
	  convention

known issues:
	- most functions don't sanity check their arguments, meaning any errors will
	  cascade and compound on each other (is this still the case?)
	- strcpy(3), memcpy(3) and MEMCPY are used inconsistently
	- there is always an empty string as the first line in the buffer

planned features:
	- explicit UTF-8 support
	- reading and writing files
	- global navigation ('34', etc.)
	- regex support
	- commands take arguments
	- plugin support
