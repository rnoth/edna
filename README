edna is a work in progress text editor inspired by the UNIX standard, ed.

(note: this document is correct as of commit 1f4bf75 ("complete overhaul") if
 this is not the lastest commit, edna may have diverged from what is described
 here)

at the moment edna is quite barebones -- the supported commands are:
	- 'd' to unlink and free and single line
	- 'h' to explain the last error
	- 'i' to insert a single line, advancing the cursor one line
	- 'p' to print the current line
	- 'q' to free the buffer and exit successfully

hacking guide:
	- the text document is represented as a doubly linked list, with functions
	  acting as manipulations on this object
	- system calls (malloc, memcpy, printf, etc.) are invoked as macros with check
	  their return value and print errno if something happens. please follow this
	  convention

known issues:
	- most functions don't sanity check their arguments, meaning any errors will
	  cascade and compound on each other
	- strcpy(3), memcpy(3) and MEMCPY are used inconsistently
	- 'i' is really 'a'

planned features:
	- explicit UTF-8 support
	- reading and writing files
	- line-by-line navigation
	- global navigation ('34', etc.)
	- regex support
	- commands take arguments
	- plugin support
