edna is a work in progress text editor inspired by the UNIX standard, ed.

(note: this document is correct as of commit 51e2f53 ("actually use line
 addresses properly always at start of buffer") if this is not the lastest
 commit, edna may have diverged from what is described here)

at the moment edna is quite barebones -- the supported commands are:
	- 'a' to append a single line, advancing the cursor one line
	- 'd' to unlink and free and single line
	- 'h' to explain the last error
	- 'p' to print the current line
	- 'q' to free the buffer and exit successfully

hacking guide:
	- the text document is represented as a doubly linked list, with functions
	  acting as manipulations on this object

known issues:
	- most functions don't sanity check their arguments, meaning any errors will
	  cascade and compound on each other
	- strcpy(3), memcpy(3) and MEMCPY are used inconsistently
	- doesn't detect and properly react to eof on stdin (^D)

planned features:
	- explicit UTF-8 support
	- reading and writing files
	- regex support
	- commands take arguments
	- plugin support
