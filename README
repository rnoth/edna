edna is a work in progress text editor inspired by the UNIX standard, ed.

(note: this document is correct as of commit ea9591 ("Initial commit.") if this
is not the lastest commit, edna may have diverged from what is described here)

at the moment edna is quite barebones -- the supported commands are:
	- 'i' to insert a single line, advancing the cursor one line
	- 'p' to print the current line
	- 'q' to free the buffer and exit successfully

hacking guide:
	- the text document is represented as a doubly linked list, with functions
	  acting as manipulations on this object
	- system calls (malloc, memcpy, printf, etc.) are invoked as macros with check
	  their return value and print errno if something happens. please follow this
	  convention

known issues:
	- most functions don't sanity check their arguments, meaning any errors will
	  cascade and compound on each other
	- printline (the 'p' command) probably does something silly if it's called
	  before a line is inserted

planned features:
	- explicit UTF-8 support
	- reading and writing files
	- line-by-line navigation
	- global navigation (':34', etc.)
	- regex support
	- commands take arguments
	- a config.h
	- plugin support
